## Introduction
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of machine learning frameworks designed by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in 2014. A GAN is composed of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, that compete with each other in a game. The generator creates new data instances, while the discriminator evaluates them for authenticity.

In this project, we implement a simple GAN to generate images of handwritten digits similar to those in the MNIST dataset.

## Results
After training the GAN, you can visualize the generated images. Below are some examples of generated digits:
